This extension was designed to wrapp up the most common implementations for an api client in an effort to stop rewriting the same code for a basic implementation.

The features present in the extension are:

```javascript
this.$api
```

# Install
```bash
quasar ext add api-wrapper
```
Quasar CLI will retrieve it from NPM and install the extension.

# Uninstall
```bash
quasar ext remove my-ext <- change name
```
